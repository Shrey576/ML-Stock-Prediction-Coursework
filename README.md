# ML-Stock-Prediction-Coursework
Developed a machine learning project using LSTM-CNN models to predict stock values of the S&amp;P500 using an open-source dataset. The model was compared with Random Forest which was used as a comparable. ARIMA was also used a simple benchmark to gage both model performances against.
